-EnemyFrequency is a float number, determining how much time passes between the spawn of the enemies. This time then is modified by a margin of 10% to add a bit of variance to timing.

-WallsFrequency is a float number, determining how much time passes between the spawn of new wall patterns. As with enemies, the time is increased or decreased by a value within 10% of the original number, so that new obstacles are a bit less predictable.

-ProjectileSpeed is a float number, determining the speed of the projectiles shot by the player.

-EnemySpeed is a float number, determining the speed at which the enemies run behind the player. As with walls' and enemies' spawn rate, the value is increased or decreased by 10%, to add a touch of unpredictability to the game.

-RunningSpeed is a float number, with a direct influence on the running speed of the player, and an indirect influence on the signals' spawn frequency.

-HorizontalSpeed is a float number, determining the horizontal speed of the player, influencing the ability to avoid walls.

-ReloadTime is a float number, determining how many seconds have to pass after a shot is fired before firing the next one.

-TrackLength is an integer number, determining how many signals the player has to pass before the end of the road is reached.
