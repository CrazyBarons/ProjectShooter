Creating a github repository for the Project.

14:50 - 07/09

Done with the repo, now the research, to see how much time I'll try investing.
I'd say 30/40 minutes are more than enough.

15:40 - 07/09

The research took a bit more time than expected, but I've now written a txt document explaining all the basic tasks of the various scripts and objects. Also, I've written down the parameters which will be modifiable by Designers.
Now I'll take 10 minutes to draw some super simple assets to use as main menu, victory and game over screens.

15:50 - 07/09

I've made 3 assets for the menu with paint. Now I'll take a break and continue either tomorrow or afterwards.
